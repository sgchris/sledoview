# Tree Support Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive tree support feature added to SledoView in version 1.1.0.

## Overview

SledoView now supports SLED's named trees feature, providing complete data isolation and organization capabilities. Users can create, select, and manage multiple trees within a single SLED database, with each tree maintaining its own separate key-value store.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components Modified

1. **Database Layer (`src/db.rs`)**
   - Added `selected_tree: Option<String>` field to `SledViewer` struct
   - Implemented tree selection state management
   - Modified all CRUD operations to respect selected tree context
   - Added tree-specific methods: `list_trees()`, `select_tree()`, `unselect_tree()`, `get_selected_tree()`
   - Enhanced iterator handling for both default and named trees

2. **Command System (`src/commands.rs`)**
   - Extended `Command` enum with new variants:
     - `Trees { pattern: String, is_regex: bool }`
     - `Select { tree: String }`
     - `Unselect`
   - Updated command parsing to handle tree commands
   - Modified `execute()` method signature to accept `&mut SledViewer`
   - Implemented execution logic for all tree commands
   - Enhanced help system with comprehensive tree documentation

3. **REPL Interface (`src/repl.rs`)**
   - Updated `SledCompleter` to support tree name completion
   - Added tree loading and caching for tab completion
   - Enhanced prompt to show selected tree: `[tree_name]>`
   - Updated command execution to use mutable viewer reference
   - Added tree refresh logic after operations

4. **Error Handling (`src/error.rs`)**
   - Added tree-specific error types:
     - `TreeNotFound { name: String }`
     - `NoTreeSelected`
     - `TreeOperation { message: String }`

### New Commands Added

#### `trees [regex] [<pattern>]`
Lists all available trees with optional pattern filtering:
- `trees` - List all trees
- `trees my_tree_*` - List trees matching glob pattern
- `trees regex tree_\d+` - List trees matching regex pattern

#### `select <tree>`
Selects a tree for all subsequent operations:
- Creates tree if it doesn't exist
- Updates prompt to show selected tree
- All CRUD operations work on selected tree

#### `unselect`
Returns to default tree context:
- Clears tree selection
- Returns prompt to normal state
- Subsequent operations work on default tree

### Behavioral Changes

1. **Context-Aware Operations**: All existing commands (`count`, `list`, `get`, `set`, `delete`, `search`) now operate within the selected tree context.

2. **Tree Isolation**: Complete separation between trees - keys in one tree don't affect or appear in others.

3. **Visual Feedback**: 
   - Prompt shows selected tree: `[tree_name]>`
   - Success/error messages indicate tree context
   - Tree selection status is clearly communicated

4. **Tab Completion**: Enhanced to include tree names for `select` and `trees` commands.

## Testing Implementation

### Unit Tests Added
- `test_list_trees()` - Tree enumeration and filtering
- `test_tree_selection()` - Tree selection/unselection logic
- `test_tree_operations_with_selection()` - CRUD operations in tree context
- `test_tree_set_and_delete_operations()` - Write operations across trees
- `test_tree_search_operations()` - Search functionality per tree
- `test_tree_errors()` - Error handling for tree operations
- Command parsing tests for all new commands

### Integration Testing
- Comprehensive end-to-end testing with sample database
- Tree isolation verification
- Cross-tree operation testing
- Error condition validation

## Sample Database Enhancement

Updated `examples/create_sample_with_trees.rs` to create a comprehensive test database with 9 trees:
- `settings` - Application configuration
- `sessions` - User session data
- `cache` - Temporary data
- `logs` - Application logs
- `metrics` - Performance metrics
- `configuration` - System config
- `binary_data` - Binary formats
- `test_data` - Edge cases
- Default tree - Basic user data

## Documentation Updates

### README.md
- Added comprehensive tree management section
- Detailed command usage examples
- Tree operation workflows
- Best practices for tree organization

### Help System
- Enhanced help command with tree sections
- Detailed usage examples
- Context-aware documentation
- Visual prompt examples

### CHANGELOG.md
- Detailed feature documentation
- Technical improvement summary
- Backward compatibility notes

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility:
- Existing commands work exactly as before when no tree is selected
- Default tree behavior unchanged
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to command syntax or behavior

## Performance Considerations

- Tree listing is cached for tab completion efficiency
- Minimal overhead when no tree is selected
- Efficient tree switching with proper resource management
- Database handles are properly managed across tree operations

## Future Enhancements

The implementation provides a solid foundation for future enhancements:
- Tree-specific statistics and analytics
- Tree export/import functionality  
- Tree-level access control
- Batch operations across multiple trees
- Tree metadata and descriptions

## Version Information

- **Version**: 1.1.0
- **Release Date**: 2025-01-19
- **Compatibility**: Fully backward compatible
- **Test Coverage**: 31 unit tests + 20 integration tests
- **New Commands**: 3 (`trees`, `select`, `unselect`)
- **Enhanced Commands**: All existing CRUD commands now tree-aware
